# Where to place downloads
#
# During a first build the system will download many different source code
# tarballs from various upstream projects. This can take a while, particularly
# if your network connection is slow. These are all stored in DL_DIR. When
# wiping and rebuilding you can preserve this directory to speed up this part of
# subsequent builds. This directory is safe to share between multiple builds on
# the same machine too.
